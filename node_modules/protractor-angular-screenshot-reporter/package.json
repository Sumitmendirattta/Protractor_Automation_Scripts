  "readme": "# Angularized HTML Reporter with Screenshots for Protractor\n\nThis is built on top of [protractor-html-screenshot-reporter](https://github.com/jintoppy/protractor-html-screenshot-reporter), which is built on top of [protractor-screenshot-reporter](https://github.com/swissmanu/protractor-screenshot-reporter).\n\n`protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter` still generates a HTML report, but it is Angular-based and improves on the original formatting.\n\n\n## Usage\nThe `protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter` module is available via npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter --save-dev\n```\n\nIn your Protractor configuration file, register `protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter` in Jasmine.\n\n#### Jasmine 1.x:\n\n```javascript\nvar HtmlReporter = require('protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter');\n\nexports.config = {\n   // your config here ...\n\n   onPrepare: function() {\n      // Add a screenshot reporter and store screenshots to `/tmp/screenshots`:\n      jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new HtmlReporter({\n         baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n      }));\n   }\n}\n```\n\n#### Jasmine 2.x:\nJasmine 2.x introduced changes to reporting that are not backwards compatible.  To use `protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter` with Jasmine 2, please make sure to use the **`getJasmine2Reporter()`** compatibility method introduced in `protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter@0.1.0`.\n\n```javascript\nvar HtmlReporter = require('protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter');\n\nexports.config = {\n   // your config here ...\n\n   onPrepare: function() {\n      // Add a screenshot reporter and store screenshots to `/tmp/screenshots`:\n      jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new HtmlReporter({\n         baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n      }).getJasmine2Reporter());\n   }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n### Base Directory (mandatory)\nYou have to pass a directory path as parameter when creating a new instance of\nthe screenshot reporter:\n\n```javascript\nvar reporter = new HtmlReporter({\n   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n});\n```\n\nIf the given directory does not exists, it is created automatically as soon as a screenshot needs to be stored.\n\n### Path Builder (optional)\nThe function passed as second argument to the constructor is used to build up paths for screenshot files:\n\n```javascript\nvar path = require('path');\n\nnew HtmlReporter({\n   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n   , pathBuilder: function pathBuilder(spec, descriptions, results, capabilities) {\n      // Return '<browser>/<specname>' as path for screenshots:\n      // Example: 'firefox/list-should work'.\n      return path.join(capabilities.caps_.browser, descriptions.join('-'));\n   }\n});\n```\nIf you omit the path builder, a [GUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier) is used by default instead.\n\nCaution: The format/structure of these parameters (spec, descriptions, results, capabilities) differs between Jasmine 2.x and Jasmine 1.x.\n\n\n### Meta Data Builder (optional)\nYou can modify the contents of the JSON meta data file by passing a function `metaDataBuilder` function as third constructor parameter:\n\n```javascript\nnew HtmlReporter({\n   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n   , metaDataBuilder: function metaDataBuilder(spec, descriptions, results, capabilities) {\n      // Return the description of the spec and if it has passed or not:\n      return {\n         description: descriptions.join(' ')\n         , passed: results.passed()\n      };\n   }\n});\n```\n\nIf you omit the meta data builder, the default implementation is used\n\n\n### Report for skipped test cases (optional)\nYou can define if you want report from skipped test cases using the `takeScreenShotsForSkippedSpecs` option:\n\n```javascript\nnew HtmlReporter({\n   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n   , takeScreenShotsForSkippedSpecs: true\n});\n```\nDefault is `false`.\n\n### Screenshots only for failed test cases (optional)\n Also you can define if you want capture screenshots only from failed test cases using the `takeScreenShotsOnlyForFailedSpecs:` option:\n \n ```javascript\n new HtmlReporter({\n    baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n    , takeScreenShotsOnlyForFailedSpecs: true\n });\n ```\n If you set the value to `true`, the reporter for the passed test will still be generated, but, there will be no screenshot.\n \n Default is `false`.\n\n\n### Add title for the html report (optional)\n Also you can define a document title for the html report generated using the `docTitle:` option:\n \n ```javascript\n new HtmlReporter({\n    baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n    , docTitle: 'my reporter'\n });\n ```\n\nDefault is `Generated test report`.\n\n### Change html report file name (optional)\n Also you can change document name for the html report generated using the `docName:` option:\n \n ```javascript\n new HtmlReporter({\n    baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n    , docName: 'index.html'\n });\n ```\nDefault is `report.html`.\n\n### Option to override CSS file used in reporter (optional)\n You can change stylesheet used for the html report generated using the `cssOverrideFile:` option:\n \n ```javascript\n new HtmlReporter({\n    baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n    , cssOverrideFile: 'css/style.css'\n });\n ```\n\n### Preserve base directory (optional)\n You can preserve (or clear) the base directory using `preserveDirectory:` option:\n \n ```javascript\n new HtmlReporter({\n    baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'\n    , preserveDirectory: false\n });\n ```\nDefault is `true`.\n\n## HTML Reporter\n\nUpon running Protractor tests with the above config, the screenshot reporter will generate JSON and PNG files for each test.\n\nIn addition, a small HTML/Angular app is copied to the output directory, which cleanly lists the test results, any errors (with stacktraces), and screenshots.\n\n\n![HTML / Angular Test Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcole/protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter/master/images/testreporter.png \"test report\")\n\nClick More Details to see more information about the test runs.\n\n![Click More Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcole/protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter/master/images/moredetail.png \"more detail\")\n\nClick View Stacktrace to see details of the error (if the test failed).\n\n![View Stacktrace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcole/protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter/master/images/stacktrace.png \"view stacktrace\")\n\nClick View Screenshot to see an image of the webpage at the end of the test.\n\n![View Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcole/protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter/master/images/screenshot.png \"view screenshot\")\n\nPlease see the `examples` folder for sample usage. \n\nTo run the sample, execute the following commands in the `examples` folder\n\n```bash\n\n$ npm install\n$ protractor protractor.conf.js\n```\n\nAfter the test run, you can see that, a screenshots folder will be created with all the reports generated. \n\n## Changelog\n### v0.1.0\nSupport for Jasmine 2.x.\nUpdating `protractor-angular-screenshot-reporter` to conform to the new custom_reporter.js format introduced by Jasmine 2.x, via compatibility method `getJasmine2Reporter`.  More details on this format can be found at: http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/custom_reporter.html\n\n### v0.0.x\nSupport for Jasmine 1.x.\n\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015 Brandon Cole <333qaz333@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.",
